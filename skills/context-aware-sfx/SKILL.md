description: Acoustic intelligence and sound design engine. Enforces authentic camera audio preservation, material-matched SFX on A4, transition SFX on A3, strict ban on interjection SFX, 100% SFX coverage on silent clips under A5 BGM, and strict Voiceover track A2 emptiness.

# Context-Aware SFX (`context-aware-sfx`)

Designs soundscapes by evaluating physical materials, acoustic environments, and genuine audio transients.

## 🎯 Directives
- **Authentic Sound First:**
  - If the source camera captured genuine physical collision sounds (breaking glass, metal slam, wood crack), BOOST Track `A1` gain by +3.0 dB to +6.0 dB.
  - DO NOT add artificial impact SFX on top of authentic camera audio (0 collision SFX on Part 1 `itv.kb*` clips and audible `Track A1` clips).
- **Strict Ban on `interjection` SFX (`R3`):**
  - All 37 vocal interjection files in `E:\Video Asset\SFX\interjection` (`What the.mp3`, `Whoa, hold on!.mp3`, `ouch.mp3`, `Oops!.mp3`, `wtf.mp3`, etc.) are strictly forbidden in `sfx_full_catalog.json`, `channel_profiles.json`, and all timelines (`0` occurrences).
- **Contextual & Peak-Aligned SFX (`Track A3`/`A4`):**
  - Look up `dur_sec` and `peak_offset_sec` in `E:\.agents\skills\visioncut\resources\sfx_full_catalog.json` (indexed SFX files in `E:\Video Asset\SFX`, excluding `interjection`).
  - Align the acoustic peak to the physical impact frame: `sfx_start_sec = timeline_impact_sec - peak_offset_sec` ($\le 1$ frame tolerance). Cap long SFX ($>3.2\text{s}$) to a tight `2.5s–3.2s` window around `peak_offset_sec`.
  - Ensure **100.0% SFX coverage** across all silent montage clips placed under `Track A5` BGM at the end of the timeline, and use only selective non-verbal reaction SFX (`windows-error.mp3`, `metal-gear-solid.mp3`, `huh.mp3`, `vine-boom.mp3`, `duck-quack.mp3`) on quiet reaction holds.
- **Speech & Voiceover Protection (INV-04 & `R3`):**
  - Track `A2` is 100% RESERVED FOR VOICEOVER (ElevenLabs `ITV 5` `eleven_v3`). NEVER place SFX or BGM overlapping active `A2` Voiceover segments (`0.000s` overlap).
- **Silent-Clip-Only BGM Policy (`Track A5` in ITV Studio Profile):**
  - Place Background Music on Track `A5` **exclusively** over clips that have no audible original sound (`peak_db <= -25 dB` or missing `A1` stream), and remove dead-silent `A1` items under `A5` BGM intervals so `Coverage(A1 | A5 | A8) = 100.00%` with `0.000s` overlap between `A1` and `A5`.
